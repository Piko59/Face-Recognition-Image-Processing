# Face Detection and Recognition using Image Processing

This repository contains a Python project for face detection and recognition using various image processing and machine learning techniques. The project implements two primary recognition methods—Eigenface and Fisherface—each utilizing different algorithms to identify and verify faces. The goal is to understand and compare these methods while identifying the strengths and limitations of each.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to detect and recognize faces within a dataset of images. It applies two methods for face recognition:
1. **Eigenface Method**: Utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify distinguishing features in faces.
2. **Fisherface Method**: Employs Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to maximize separability between classes, improving recognition performance in varied conditions, such as changes in lighting and expressions.

The results are evaluated through various metrics to understand the effectiveness of each method.

## Key Features
- **Face Detection**: Identifies faces in images, pre-processes them, and prepares them for recognition.
- **Eigenface and Fisherface Recognition**: Implements and compares two distinct facial recognition methods.
- **Dataset Handling**: Loads and preprocesses images for consistency across models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides detailed experimental results with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **OpenCV**: For image processing and face detection.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data handling.
  - **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning, including PCA, LDA, and SVM.
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Methods and Implementation Details

### 1. Eigenface Method
The Eigenface method uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the main features (eigenfaces) that distinguish different faces in the dataset.

- **Preprocessing**:
  - **Size Normalization**: All images are resized to a common size (e.g., 64x64 pixels).
  - **Intensity Normalization**: Converts images to grayscale to reduce data complexity.
  - **Geometric Normalization**: Aligns facial features to improve consistency.

- **Creating Eigenfaces**:
  - Eigenfaces are generated by applying PCA on the face images. The principal components represent the main variance in the dataset.
  - Each face is represented as a weighted combination of these eigenfaces, reducing the dimensionality and allowing for efficient recognition.

- **Recognition**:
  - Unknown faces are projected into the eigenface space, and similarity is calculated using a distance metric to identify the closest match.

### 2. Fisherface Method
The Fisherface method applies Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) after PCA to further improve class separability, making it more robust to lighting changes and variations in facial expressions.

- **Preprocessing**: Similar to the Eigenface method, including size, intensity, and geometric normalization.
- **Creating Fisherfaces**:
  - PCA is used initially to reduce dimensionality, followed by LDA to maximize inter-class variation while minimizing intra-class variation.
- **Recognition**:
  - The Fisherface representation is used to compare and identify faces based on their class features, offering improved accuracy in challenging conditions.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises images of 9 individuals, each represented by approximately 30 images with varying expressions, angles, and lighting. Images are normalized and preprocessed for consistent input to the models. The diversity in the dataset allows the models to learn to distinguish between faces and recognize different expressions of the same individual.

## Experimental Results
After implementing both methods, the models were tested and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Key findings include:

- **Eigenface Method**: This method performed reasonably well but struggled under different lighting and facial expressions due to the nature of PCA.
- **Fisherface Method**: Demonstrated greater robustness to variations in lighting and expressions, providing higher accuracy in face recognition.

An example test result showed an accuracy rate of approximately 83% for recognizing an individual (Emre) across multiple images. This suggests that the Fisherface method may be more reliable for practical applications.
